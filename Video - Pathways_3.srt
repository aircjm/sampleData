1
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.270
Are you satisfied with your work? 

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.160
Today? 

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.120
We are talking about job satisfaction or the things people need to be happy at work. 

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.560
What do you think is most important to people? 

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.770
You might be surprised that it is not money.

6
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.710
One thing that many people look for a job that helps other people. 

7
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.740
In general, people want to help other people. 

8
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.900
They want to make the world a better place. 

9
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.230
Teachers are normally at the top of the list of happiest jobs. 

10
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.160
Every day, teachers help people learn and grow. 

11
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.520
Think about your favorite teacher. 

12
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.150
Most likely he or she was happy at work.

13
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.880
Another thing people want from a job is to create things. 

14
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.110
They want to use their minds. 

15
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.550
They don't want to be in a boring job. 

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.820
They don't want to sit at a desk every day and look at a computer.

17
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.310
Engineers are also usually at the top of the list of happiest jobs. 

18
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.160
Engineers create new products. 

19
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.270
It's very exciting when they finally see their new product. 

20
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.160
When was the last time you made something? 

21
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.870
Did it make you happy? 

22
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.290
Also, people want their boss to thank them for the work they do. 

23
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.330
When a boss thanks their workers for their good work, they feel more satisfied with their jobs. 

24
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.810
And when people are satisfied in their jobs, they try hard.

25
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.260
Finally, people want to have happy coworkers. 

26
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.460
Everybody wants to enjoy their day at work. 

27
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.740
When coworkers work hard, like their job, and are friendly, there's a good work environment. 

28
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.820
A job is a lot of fun when you work together with other happy people.

29
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.680
Of course, there are other things that people look for in a job. 

30
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.380
Money matters and where you work is important. 

31
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.820
But overall, being happy is most important to many people for.
